To do
---
0. Finish up current classes - Add them to class select ui
1. Experience system and bar
2. Saving and loading
3. Progression for each class
4. More abilities

Later considerations
---
- Should the PlayerClass or Player be setting up the cooldownbar?
- Net code optimizations
- CanBeHitByNPC has a lsit in it that is fully cleared by leap isntead of picking and choosing waht to remove
- PlayerClass and even Ability does not need children in the future in the constructor requirements don't get too crazy, similar to how I implemented ClassChangeButton
	I was probably not realizing I could keep each class's progression system seperate from it's actual instantiation early on
- UI code currently feels like a mess... but it works...
